TASK: Mr. Bodrog is highly interested in profitability.

He wants to know the average interest of all deposits groups and whether a deposit has expired or not.

But that is not all. He wants you to select deposits with a starting date after 01/01/1985.

Order the data in descending order by Deposit Group and in ascending order by Expiration Flag.



SELECT `deposit_group`, `is_deposit_expired`, AVG(`deposit_interest`) AS 'average_interest'
FROM `wizard_deposits`
WHERE `deposit_start_date` > '1985-01-01'
GROUP BY `deposit_group`, `is_deposit_expired`
ORDER BY `deposit_group` DESC, `is_deposit_expired`;
