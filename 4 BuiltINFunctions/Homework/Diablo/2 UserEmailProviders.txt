TASK: Find information about the email providers of all users.

Display the user_name and the email provider.

Order the results alphabetically by the email provider, then by username.



SELECT `user_name`, SUBSTRING_INDEX(email, '@', -1) AS 'Email Provider' 
FROM `users`
ORDER BY `Email Provider`, `user_name`;


In this query, the SUBSTRING_INDEX(email, '@', -1) function is used to extract the portion of the email after the '@' symbol, which represents the email provider. By using -1 as the count argument, it selects the rightmost portion of the string after the last occurrence of '@'.
