TASK: Combine the names of all peaks and rivers so that the last letter of each peakâ€™s name is identical to the first letter of the river name.

The matching letters must overlap, as shown below.

Display the peak name, the river name, and the obtained mix (converted to lowercase).

Order the results alphabetically by the mix.



SELECT `peak_name`, `river_name`, LOWER(CONCAT(peak_name, SUBSTRING(river_name, 2))) AS 'mix'
FROM `peaks`,`rivers`
WHERE RIGHT(`peak_name`,1) LIKE(LEFT(`river_name`, 1))
ORDER BY `mix`;
