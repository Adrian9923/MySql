Select all drivers and the cars that they drive.

Order the result by the mileage in descending order, then by the first name alphabetically.

Skip all cars that have NULL as a value for the mileage.

SELECT d.`first_name`, d.`last_name`, c.`make`, c.`model`, c.`mileage`
FROM `cars` AS c
JOIN `cars_drivers` AS cd ON cd.`car_id` = c.`id`
JOIN `drivers` AS d ON d.`id` = cd.`driver_id`
WHERE c.`mileage` IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY c.`mileage` DESC, `first_name`;
