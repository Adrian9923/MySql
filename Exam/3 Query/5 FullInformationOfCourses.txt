TASK: The headquarters want us to write a query that shows the complete information about all courses in the database.

The information that they need is the address, if the course is made in the Day (between 6 and 20 inclusive) or in the Night (between 21 and 5 inclusive), the bill of the course, the full name of the client, the car maker, the model, and the name of the category.

Order the results by course id.

Required Columns

"name" (address)

"day_time"

"bill"

"full_name" (client)

"make"

"model"

"category_name" (category)



SELECT a.`name`, 
CASE
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM co.`start`) BETWEEN 6 AND 20 THEN 'Day'
        ELSE 'Night'
    END AS 'day_time',
co.`bill`,
cl.`full_name`,
c.`make`,
c.`model`,
categ.`name`
FROM `addresses` AS a
JOIN `courses` AS co ON co.`from_address_id` = a.`id`
JOIN `clients` AS cl ON cl.`id` = co.`client_id`
JOIN `cars` AS c ON c.`id` = co.`car_id`
JOIN `categories` AS categ ON categ.`id` = c.`category_id`
