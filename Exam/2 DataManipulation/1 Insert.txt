TASK: When drivers are not working and need a taxi to transport them, they will also be registered at the database as customers.

You will have to insert records of data into the clients table based on the drivers table.

For all drivers with an id between 10 and 20 (both inclusive), insert data in the clients table with the following values:

"full_name" - Get first and last name of the driver separated by single space

"phone_number" - Set it to start with (088) 9999 followed by the driver_id multiplied by 2

Example - the phone_number of the driver with an id 10 is (088) 999920




INSERT INTO `clients`(`full_name`, `phone_number`)
SELECT CONCAT_WS(' ', d.`first_name`, d.`last_name`) AS 'full_name',
CONCAT('(088)9999', d.`id` * 2) AS 'phone_number'
FROM `drivers` AS d
WHERE d.`id` BETWEEN 10 AND 20;

INSERT INTO clients (full_name, phone_number)
SELECT CONCAT_WS(' ', d.first_name, d.last_name) AS full_name,
       CONCAT('(088) 9999', LPAD(d.id * 2, 2, '0')) AS phone_number
FROM drivers AS d
WHERE d.id BETWEEN 10 AND 20;
In this modified query, the LPAD function is used to pad the driver's ID multiplied by 2 with leading zeros if necessary to ensure a two-digit value. The phone_number column will now have the format (088) 9999XX, where XX is the padded driver ID multiplied by 2.
