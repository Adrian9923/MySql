TASK: Write a stored procedure usp_raise_salary_by_id(id) that raises the salary of a given employee (found by using their id) by 5%.

Keep in mind that you cannot promote a non-existent employee - if that happens, the database should be left unchanged.

Example
The following example is the result of calling the procedure with an employee_id of 17.

first_name
14175.0000


DELIMITER &&

CREATE PROCEDURE `usp_raise_salary_by_id`(`id` INT)
BEGIN

UPDATE `employees`
SET `salary` = `salary` * 1.05
WHERE `employee_id` = `id`;

END; &&

CALL `usp_raise_salary_by_id`(17); &&

SELECT `salary`
FROM `employees`
WHERE `employee_id` = 17;
