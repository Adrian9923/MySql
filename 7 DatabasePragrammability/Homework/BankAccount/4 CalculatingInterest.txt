TASK: Your task is to write a stored procedure usp_calculate_future_value_for_account that accepts two parameters - an account id and an interest rate.

The procedure uses the function from the previous problem to calculate the future value of a person's account for 5 years, along with information about their account id, first name, last name and current balance, as shown in the example below.

As mentioned above, it accepts the account_id and the interest_rate as parameters.

The interest rate should have precision up to 0.0001, the same as the calculated balance after 5 years.

It is important to achieve the specified precision.

Example
Here is the result for account_id = 1 and interest_rate = 0.1.



DELIMITER &&
CREATE FUNCTION `ufn_calculate_future_value`(`sum` DECIMAL(19,4), `yearly_interest_rate` DOUBLE, `number_of_years` INT) RETURNS DECIMAL(19,4) DETERMINISTIC
BEGIN
DECLARE `future_value` DECIMAL(19,4);
SET `future_value` = `sum` * POWER((1 + `yearly_interest_rate`), `number_of_years`);
RETURN `future_value`;
END; &&

DELIMITER &&
CREATE PROCEDURE `usp_calculate_future_value_for_account`(`acc_id` INT, `interest_rate` DECIMAL(19,4))

BEGIN
SELECT  a.`id` AS 'account_id', ah.`first_name`, ah.`last_name`, a.`balance` AS 'current_balance',
`ufn_calculate_future_value`(`balance`, `interest_rate`, 5) AS 'balance_in_5_years'
FROM `account_holders` AS ah
JOIN  `accounts` AS a ON a.`account_holder_id` = ah.`id`
WHERE a.`id` = `acc_id`;
END; &&

CALL `usp_calculate_future_value_for_account`(1,0.1); &&
