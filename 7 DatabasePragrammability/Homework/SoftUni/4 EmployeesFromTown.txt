TASK: Write a stored procedure usp_get_employees_from_town that accepts town_name as a parameter and returns the first and last names of the employees living in the given town.

The result should be sorted alphabetically (by first_name, then by last_name) as a first criterion and by id in ascending order as a second criterion.

Examples
Here is a list of employees living in Sofia.

WHERE t.`name` = `given_town`
ORDER BY e.`first_name`, e.`last_name`, e.`employee_id`;
