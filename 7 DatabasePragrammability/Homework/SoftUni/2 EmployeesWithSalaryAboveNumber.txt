TASK: Use the database that is called "SoftUni Database".

Write a stored procedure usp_get_employees_salary_above.

It should accept a decimal number (with a precision of 4 digits after the decimal point) as a parameter and returns the first and last names of all employees with a salary above or equal to the given number.

The result must be sorted alphabetically (by first_name, then by last_name) as a first criterion and by id in ascending order as a second criterion.

Example
Supplied number for that example is 45000.
