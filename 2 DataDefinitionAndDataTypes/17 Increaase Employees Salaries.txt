Task:  Use the softuni database and increase the salaries of all employees by 10%. Then select only the salary column from the employees table.


update `employees`
set `salary` = salary * 1.1;
select `salary` from `employees`;




if I dont want to use WHERE clause I can do this:
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES=0;
update `employees`
set `salary` = salary * 1.1;
select `salary` from `employees`;



Original syntax:(exmple from google)
update your_table
set price = price * 1.2
where id = (some condition)
