TASK: Before continuing with the next assignments, rename the town_id to id using the Workbench's GUI.

Change the structure of the Minions table to have a new column called town_id that should be of the same type as the id column of the towns table.

Add a new constraint that makes town_id a foreign key and references the id column of the towns table.





ALTER TABLE `towns`
RENAME COLUMN `town_id` to `id`;

ALTER TABLE `minions`
ADD `town_id` INT;

ALTER TABLE `minions`
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_minions_towns
FOREIGN KEY (`town_id`)
REFERENCES `towns`(`id`);
