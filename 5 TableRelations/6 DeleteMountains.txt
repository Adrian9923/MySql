TASK: Use the tables from the first problem - Mountains and Peaks.

Write a query to create a one-to-many relationship between one table, holding information about mountains (id, name) and another table - about peaks (id, name, mountain_id), so that when a mountain gets removed from the database, all of its peaks get deleted too.




CREATE TABLE `mountains` (
`id` INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
`name` VARCHAR(45)
);

CREATE TABLE `peaks` (
`id` INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
`name` VARCHAR(10),
`mountain_id` INT,
FOREIGN KEY(`mountain_id`)
REFERENCES `mountains`(`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
