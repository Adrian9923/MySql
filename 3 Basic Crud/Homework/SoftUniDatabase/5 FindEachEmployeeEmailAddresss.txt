TASK: Use the database that is called "SoftUni Database".

Write an SQL query to find the email address of each employee. Consider that the email domain is softuni.bg.

Name the the resulting column as full_email_address.

The email addresses are not present in any of the tables but you can generate a list based on the first and last names of each employee, followed by the email domain.

The emails should be in the following format: "John.Doe@softuni.bg".



SELECT CONCAT(`first_name`, '.', `last_name`, '@softuni.bg') AS 'full_email_address'
FROM `employees`;
